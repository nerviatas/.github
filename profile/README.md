# Nerviatas Cybernetics

_Firmware. Control. Sovereignty._

Nerviatas unites a new class of neuroâ€‘technologies: neural interfaces, intelligent firmware,
and control systems that restore, extend, and dignify human capability.

Our engineering ethos is forged in Stoic and Roman virtues. Designs that are disciplined,
resilient, and refined rather than flashy or loud.

We value anatomical elegance, data sovereignty, and uphold a _Codex Virtutum_ that describes
the _Guiding Principles for Ethical Cybernetics_, which can be viewed here: https://nerviatas.com/codex.

## What we do

We build the control stack for responsive prosthetics and human augmentation.
Our focus is robustness, low latency, and clear engineering you can inspect and trust.

## Why this matters

Prosthetic control usually trades speed for stability. We do both. Research teams need quick iteration.
Users need reliability every time they move. Our stack serves both needs without hidden magic.

## Design values

- Tight control loops with clear safety limits
- Deterministic dataflows that you can replay
- Logs and metrics first. Features second
- Replace any part without breaking the rest

## What is open here

You will find high level docs, example schemas, and small utilities that help the community.
Core production code lives in private repos. We publish what is useful to others and does not create safety risk.

## Work with us

If you work in prosthetics, control, embedded, perception, or tooling and this direction resonates,

## Responsible use

We build systems that interact with people. Any use must include risk analysis, limits, and supervised validation.
Do not deploy our examples on devices that can harm users or bystanders. Test offline first. Then hardware in the loop.
Then field trials with proper oversight.
